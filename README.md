A calendar to show when bills need to be paid. This new website allows users to create or track their budget by entering income/expenses directly into a monthly calendar. The amounts entered are totaled at the bottom each day.

I had an idea to create this website based on improvements I had on Vertex42's spreadsheet. The main limitation was not being able to input more than 4 transactions directly on each day. This calendar allows users to enter in as many transactions as they desire on each day.

This website is inspired by Vertex42's excel spreadsheet:
