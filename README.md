# Budget Calendar

## Overview
The Budget Calendar is a web application designed to display when bills are due. It enables users to create or track their budget by inputting income and expenses directly into a monthly calendar. The entered amounts are automatically totaled at the bottom of each day for easier financial tracking.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by improvements identified in Vertex42's Budget Calendar spreadsheet. A notable limitation of the spreadsheet was its restriction on entering more than four transactions per day. The Budget Calendar resolves this issue, allowing users to input an unlimited number of transactions for each day.
